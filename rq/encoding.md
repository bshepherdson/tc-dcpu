# Instruction Encoding

Following the usual presentation of ARM7 Thumb, this is presented as a set of
"formats", sometimes comprising several instructions.

Conventions: `ooo` or similar specifies the exact operation, `____` is a
literal values, `sss`, `aaa`, `bbb` and `ddd` are 3-bit register numbers
corresponding to operands (`aaa` and `bbb`), shifts (`sss`) and destinations
(`ddd`). Others are format-specific. `___` is "don't care".

1. `000ooXXXXXsssddd` - Move shifted register
2. `00011IoXXXsssddd` - Add/subtract
3. `001oodddXXXXXXXX` - Move/compare/add/subtract immediate
4. `010000oooosssddd` - ALU operations
5. `010001100L___aaa` - `BX` and `BLX`
6. `010001101oo__ddd` - Hardware (`HWN`, `HWQ` and `HWI`)

### Format 8 - `PC`-relative load

`01001dddXXXXXXXX`

- `ddd` - Destination register `Rd`
- `XXXXXXXX` - 8-bit unsigned offset

`LDR Rd, [PC, #Imm]`

Remember that `PC` points at the next instruction during execution of this one.
(Put another way, `LDR Rd, [PC, #0]` will load the next instruction into `Rd`.)

1 cycle. Does **not** set `CPSR` condition codes.



### Format 9 - Load/store with register offset

`0101LP0aaabbbddd`

- `L` - 0 = store, 1 = load

### Format 12 - Unused (load/store halfword)

`1000`


### Format 13 - `SP`-relative load/store

`1001LdddXXXXXXXX`

- `L` - 0 = store, 1 = load
- `ddd` - Source/destination register `Rd`
- `XXXXXXXX` - 8-bit unsigned offset from `SP`

Note that `SP` is expected to be a "full-descending" stack, that is `SP`
points at the value on top of the stack.

| `L` | Assembly | Meaning |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| `0` | `STR Rd, [SP, #Imm]` | Store `Rd` to memory at `SP + Imm`. |
| `1` | `LDR Rd, [Rb, #Imm]` | Read memory at `SP + Imm`, write to `Rd`. |

- `ddd` - Destination register `Rd`
- `XXXXXXXX` - 8-bit unsigned immediate

| `S` | Assembly | Meaning |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| `0` | `ADD Rd, PC, #Imm` | Add `Imm` to the current value of `PC`, and load the result into `Rd`. |
| `1` | `ADD Rd, SP, #Imm` | Add `Imm` to the current value of SP, and load the result into `Rd`. |

Note that this puts an address into `Rd`, not the value in memory at that spot!

Note that `PC` points to the instruction after this one.

1 cycle. Does **not** set `CPSR` condition codes.


### Format 15 - Adjust stack pointer

`10110000SXXXXXXX`

- `S` - 0 = add, 1 = subtract

| `1` | `SUB SP, #Imm` | Subtract `Imm` from `SP` |

1 cycle. Does **not** set `CPSR` condition codes.


### Format 16 - Push/pop registers

`1011L10Rrrrrrrrr`

- `L` - 0 = store/push, 1 = load/pop
- `R` - 1 = store `LR`/load `PC`
- `rrrrrrrr` - Register list, `r0` = LSB, `r7` = MSB, set to load/store that
  register.

| `L` | `R` | Assembly | Meaning |
| :---: | :---: | :-- | :-- |
| `0` | `0` | `PUSH { Rlist }` | Push the registers onto the stack, update `SP`. |

| `1` | `1` | `POP { Rlist, PC }` | Pop the registers and `PC` from the stack, update `SP`. |

Registers are pushed in "ascending" order in memory. Pushing `r0`, `r3`, and
`LR` looks like:

```
sp+3: ...
sp+2: LR
sp+1: r3
sp+0: r0
```

Popping expects them in the same order, of course.

Note that popping `PC` constitutes a branch.

1 cycle per regular register stored/loaded. 1 extra for storing `LR`, and 2 extra
for loading `PC`.

Does **not** set the `CPSR` condition codes.


### Format 17 - Multiple load/store

`1100Lbbbrrrrrrrr`

- `L` - 0 = store, 1 = load
- `bbb` - Base register `Rb`
- `rrrrrrrr` - Register list. `r0` = LSB, `r7` = MSB. Set to load/store that
  register.

| `L` | Assembly | Meaning |
| :---: | :-- | :-- |
| `0` | `STMIA Rb!, { Rlist }` | Store the registers from Rlist starting at the address given by `Rb`. |
| `1` | `LDMIA Rb!, { Rlist }` | Load the registers in Rlist starting at the address given by `Rb`. |

The registers are stored in ascending order, with the lowest-numbered register
at the original `[Rb]`. `Rb` is updated after this operation, with the result
that `Rb` ends up pointing after the last word written.

1 cycle per register loaded or stored. It is an illegal instruction for
`rrrrrrrr` to be empty.

Does **not** set the `CPSR` condition codes.

### Format 18 - Conditional branches

`1101ccccXXXXXXXX`

These instructions all perform a conditional branch depending on the `CPSR`
condition codes (`N`, `Z`, `C` and `V`).

The offset `XXXXXXXX` is a **signed** (2's complement) 8-bit offset from the
current `PC`. Recall that `PC` points at the next instruction, not at this one.

| `cccc` | Assembly | Meaning |
| :----: | :--- | :--- |
| `0000` | `BEQ label` | Branch if `Z` set (equal) |
| `0001` | `BNE label` | Branch if `Z` clear (not equal) |
| `0010` | `BCS label` | Branch if `C` set (unsigned higher or same) |
| `0011` | `BCC label` | Branch if `C` clear (unsigned lower) |
| `0100` | `BMI label` | Branch if `N` set (negative) |
| `0101` | `BPL label` | Branch if `N` clear (positive or zero) |
| `0110` | `BVS label` | Branch if `V` set (overflow) |
| `0111` | `BVC label` | Branch if `V` clear (no overflow) |
| `1000` | `BHI label` | Branch if `C` set and `Z` clear (unsigned higher) |
| `1001` | `BLS label` | Branch if `C` clear or `Z` set (unsigned lower or same) |
| `1010` | `BGE label` | Branch if `N` and `V` match (signed greater or equal) |
| `1011` | `BLT label` | Branch if `N` and `V` differ (signed less than) |
| `1100` | `BGT label` | Branch if `Z` clear, and `N` and `V` match (signed greater than) |
| `1101` | `BLE label` | Branch if `Z` set, or `N` and `V` differ (signed less than or equal) |
| `1110` | (illegal) | (Undefined opcode.) |
| `1111` | (illegal) | (This is format 19, software interrupt.) |

Branches take 2 cycles if they fail and 1 cycle to they succeed. (Prefetching
expects conditional branches to succeed.)

Branches examine the `CPSR` condition codes but don't change them.


### Format 19 - Software interrupts

`11011111XXXXXXXX`

`SWI Imm8`

A `SWI` is like a function call to a fixed location.

The immediate field is **ignored** by the processor, it's simply an annotation
or comment the `SWI` handler can use to determine which SWI is requested.

To execute a `SWI`, the processor sets `LR_swi` to the current `PC` (ie. the
instruction after the SWI), saves `CPSR` to `SPSR_swi`, and sets `CPSR` to
`$0011` (flags clear, interrupts disabled, SWI mode). Finally, it sets `PC` to
`$10`, the SWI vector.

Exiting a software interrupt handler is similar to exiting an IRQ: Set the mode
back to what it was before. This is done with `RSI`, which sets `CPSR` to
`SPSR_swi` and `PC` to `LR_swi`.

Note that SWIs share the `SP` and general purpose registers with User mode, and so
must restore them before returning.

Unlike IRQs, however, SWIs happen on demand and at predictable times, so it's
valid and safe for them to consume or return values to/from the user code in the
general-purpose registers and on the stack.

It's safe to nest from an IRQ to a SWI, or vice-versa. SWIs and IRQs are
nestable with extreme care to keep the `SPSR` and `LR` safe.

2 cycles. Does **not** change `CPSR` condition codes, though it does swap the
current `CPSR` for another.


### Format 20 - Unconditional branch

`11100XXXXXXXXXXX`

- `XXXXXXXXXXX` is an 11-bit 2's complement signed offset.

`B label` - Branches unconditionally to `PC + offset`.

Remember that `PC` points to the instruction after this one.

Does not set `LR` or the `CPSR` condition codes.



### Format 21 - Immediate branch and link

`11111XXXXXXXXXXX`

- `XXXXXXXXXXX` - 11-bit unsigned absolute address

`BL label` where the target address is small enough to fit into 11 bits gets
assembled like this. `LR` is set to `PC`, and `PC` is set to the immediate value.

1 cycle, does **not** set `CPSR` condition codes.


### Format 22 - Long branch and link

`11110H__XXXXXXXX`

When the absolute address is too big for 11 bits (and therefore can't use format
21), this two-instruction form is used.

The first instruction has `H=1` and gives the high 8 bits. Those 8 bits are
written into `LR` and shifted up by 8.

The second instruction has `H=0` and gives the low 8 bits. Those 8 bits are
ORed with `LR`, given the full 16-bit address in `LR`.

Then `LR` is exchanged with `PC`, effectively performing a branch-and-link to
the absolute address.

The assembly is `BL label`, and the assembler will choose format 21 or 22 based
on the size of the absolute address.

Each part of this two-part instruction takes 1 cycle, for a total of 2 cycles.

(Note that it's not obvious from the assembly code whether a `BL label` takes 1
cycle or 2. If that's important to your code, you'll have to work out which form
it is based on the value of `label`, or hand-assemble the two-instruction form.)


Does not change `CPSR` condition codes.
